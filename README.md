Forgolang.com's open-source discussion forum system.\
But you can also use it as a small framework. :)

## Roadmap
 - [x] Core system
 - [x] Authorization system integration
 - [ ] All modules integrations (category, posts, chat)
 - [ ] Notification system integration
 - [ ] CI/CD Tools integration


***Switching to DDD architecture. It will work soon and a more streamlined development environment will be released.

That's all for now. :)

## Requirements
 - Go > 1.11.x
 - PostgreSQL
 - Redis 
 - RabbitMQ
 - Elasticsearch 7.x

## Development
```shell script
git clone -b develop https://github.com/streetbyters/forgolang_forum

go mod vendor

go run ./cmd -genSecretEnv

# Development Mode
go run ./cmd -mode dev -migrate -reset
go run ./cmd -mode dev

# Test Mode
go run ./cmd -mode test -migrate -reset
go run ./cmd -mode test
```

## Tasks
If you have added a new API endpoint.
```shell script
go run ./cmd -mode dev -task -name GenerateRolePermissions
```
#### Add Task
Create task file on ***tasks*** directory. On the bottom you can also see the sample task function.
```go
package tasks

import "forgolang_forum/cmn"

// ExampleTask for forgolang_forum
func ExampleTask(app *cmn.App, args ...interface{}) {
    app.Logger.LogInfo("Example Task")
}
```

After creating the task file, define the task to the task section in the ***cmd/main.go*** file.
```go
package main

func main() {
    ...
    // Tasks
    _ts["ExampleTask"] = tasks.ExampleTask
    // Tasks
    ...
}
```
Finally, call the task from the command line.
```shell script
go run ./cmd -mode dev -task -name ExampleTask
```
